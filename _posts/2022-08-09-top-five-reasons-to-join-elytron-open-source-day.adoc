Last month, we were thrilled to announce that the https://wildfly-security.github.io/wildfly-elytron/[WildFly Elytron] project
was selected for https://ghc.anitab.org/programs-and-awards/open-source-day/[Open Source Day], an all-day hackathon hosted
by https://anitab.org/[AnitaB.org] as part of the https://ghc.anitab.org/[Grace Hopper Celebration]. This is our third
time taking part in this event, after having participated in the Summer Open Source Day and the Grace Hopper Open Source Day last year.

As a female project maintainer myself, it's very inspiring to be part of the largest female-led movement in open source!
With a little over a month left before the big day, we wanted to let you know our top 5 reasons for joining us on the
WildFly Elytron project at Open Source Day in September.

== 1. Guided Introduction To Open Source

Have you ever wanted to contribute to an open source project but weren't quite sure where to start? This is finally
your chance to have a guided introduction to open source. We will have a wide variety of good first issues to choose from
and we will help you pick and work on issues. Have a question on how to solve an issue? Don't worry! We'll be there to help
answer your questions, help with setting up your developer environment, and help you submit your pull requests all day.

== 2. Hone Your Skills

Want to learn more about Java? Have questions about Git or Maven? Want to learn how to create a nicely formatted
pull request that's easy to review? We will have WildFly Elytron project maintainers and mentors available to
discuss these concepts and help answer any questions you might have.

== 3. No Prior Experience Needed

Not familiar with security yet? Are you new to Java? That's totally fine! We will have lots of different issues to
choose from and will be happy to help you work on them. No prior experience is needed. A lot of contributors to
the WildFly Elytron project are brand new to security when they begin.

== 4. Ask Us Anything

Have general questions about contributing to open source projects or wonder what it's like having a full-time job
in open source? Want to get a maintainer's perspective on the pull request review process? This is your chance to ask
absolutely anything you'd like to! Take advantage of this time.

== 5. Have An Impact

WildFly Elytron is the security framework that's used by the WildFly application server. It's used to secure
apps that are deployed to the server and to secure access to the server itself. Banks, retail stores, and
governments are just some examples of end-users of the enterprise version of WildFly. Your contributions
to the WildFly Elytron project will have an impact for these end-users!
